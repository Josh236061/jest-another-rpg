Rice Bootcamp Module Assignment 10: Jest Another RPG

## User Story
I want to create a command-line role-playing game 
(RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose 
health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. Your game 
will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, 
and youâ€™ll also implement basic code tests using the Jest 
framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
