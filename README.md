Rice Bootcamp Module Assignment 10: Jest Another RPG

## User Story
I want to create a command-line role-playing game 
(RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose 
health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. Your game 
will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, 
and youâ€™ll also implement basic code tests using the Jest 
framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I integrate constructor function into my applications

THEN I add structure to my code & reduce the amount of code I have to write

WHEN I build entire applications using OOP

THEN I separate data and functionality into distinct constructor functions that can be composed together

WHEN I use automated tests

THEN I verify if my code works via the automated tests

WHEN I build applications using TDD

THEN I write tests before implementing functionality

WHEN I use modern ES6 class syntax

THEN I implement more advanced OOP patterns (i.e. inheritance)

WHEN I use OOP paradigm

THEN  I create scalable applications
